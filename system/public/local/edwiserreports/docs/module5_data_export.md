# Module 5: Data Export

## Overview
This module covers all functionality related to exporting reports in Edwiser Reports Pro, ensuring robust, accessible, and standards-compliant export features for Moodle 5.0+.

## Completed Tasks
- **Task 1:** Fixed export issues and ensured compatibility with Moodle 5.0+:
  - All export filenames are now sanitized using Moodle's `clean_filename()` and truncated to a maximum of 200 characters to prevent failures with long filenames.
  - Fixed deprecation warnings in the completion block export by using `is_numeric()` before rounding grades, outputting 'N/A' for non-numeric values.
  - Export logic is robust and compatible with modern Moodle versions.

## Key Files
- `local/edwiserreports/classes/export.php` — Core export logic for CSV, Excel, PDF, and email
- `local/edwiserreports/download.php` — Handles export requests and permissions
- `local/edwiserreports/classes/reports/courseactivitycompletion.php` — Completion block export logic
- `local/edwiserreports/arraytoxlsx.php` — Excel file generation

## Best Practices Followed
- [Moodle File and Media Handling](https://moodledev.io/docs/apis/core/files)
- [Moodle Error Handling](https://moodledev.io/docs/apis/core/dml/errors)
- [Moodle Plugin Structure](https://moodledev.io/docs/apis/core/plugins)

## Notes for Maintainers
- All export filenames are now safe for all supported filesystems and browsers.
- Grade export logic is robust against non-numeric values and PHP deprecations.
- Export logic is modular and can be extended for new formats or data sources.
