# Module 4: Scheduled Tasks & Cron

## Overview
This module covers all scheduled/background processing for Edwiser Reports Pro, ensuring robust, maintainable, and standards-compliant scheduled tasks for Moodle 5.0+.

## Completed Tasks
- **Task 1:** Fixed PHP 8.2+ deprecation warnings by explicitly declaring all dynamic properties in scheduled task classes.
- **Task 2:** Improved error handling and logging:
  - All scheduled tasks now wrap main logic in `try/catch` blocks.
  - Errors for individual records/filters/courses/time periods are logged with `mtrace()` and do not halt the entire task.
  - Fatal errors for the whole task are logged with `mtrace()`.
  - All output uses `mtrace()` (no `echo` or HTML).
- **Task 3:** Ensured all scheduled tasks are registered and clearly documented in `db/tasks.php` with inline comments for maintainers and admins.

## Registered Scheduled Tasks
- `send_scheduled_emails`: Sends scheduled report emails to users based on configured schedules.
- `update_course_progress_data`: Updates course progress data for all users and triggers completion events as needed.
- `site_access_data`: Aggregates and updates site access information for reporting.
- `active_courses_data`: Aggregates and updates active courses data for reporting.
- `active_users_data`: Aggregates and updates active users data for reporting.
- `studentengagement_data`: Pre-calculates and updates student engagement data for reporting.

## Key Files
- `local/edwiserreports/classes/task/*.php` — All scheduled task class implementations
- `local/edwiserreports/db/tasks.php` — Task registration and documentation

## Best Practices Followed
- [Moodle Scheduled Tasks and Background Processing](https://moodledev.io/docs/apis/core/task)
- [Moodle Error Handling](https://moodledev.io/docs/apis/core/dml/errors)
- [Moodle Performance Optimization](https://moodledev.io/docs/guides/performance)

## Notes for Maintainers
- All scheduled tasks are now robust against PHP 8.2+ property deprecations.
- Error handling is consistent and will not halt processing for single-record failures.
- All tasks are documented for clarity and future maintenance.
