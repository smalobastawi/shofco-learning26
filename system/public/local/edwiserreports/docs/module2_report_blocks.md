# Module 2: Report Blocks — Documentation

## Overview
This module modernizes and standardizes the report blocks in Edwiser Reports Pro for Moodle 5.0+ compatibility, accessibility, and maintainability.

## Key Changes
- **Ellipsis (block actions) menu:**
  - Now a direct child of `.block-header` with correct CSS positioning.
  - Button and menu have ARIA attributes for accessibility.
  - Only one dropdown can be open at a time; closes on outside click/Esc.
  - Keyboard navigation supported (tab, Enter/Space, arrow keys).
- **Info icon (block description/tooltips):**
  - Added accessible info icon with tooltip using Moodle's `core/tooltip` AMD module.
  - Keyboard and screen reader accessible.
- **Deprecation warnings:**
  - All dynamic properties in scheduled tasks (e.g., `active_users_data`) are now explicitly declared with PHPDoc.
- **"Completed Activities" count:**
  - Now matches Moodle's standard: counts completions across all activities with completion enabled for all enrolled users, and displays an overall completion rate.

## Technical Approach
- Followed Moodle's AMD/JS, accessibility, and PHP coding standards.
- Used `$DB` API for all database queries (see [moodle-database-patterns] rule).
- Used ARIA and keyboard navigation best practices for all interactive UI.
- All new/changed PHP code uses explicit property declarations and PHPDoc.

## Manual QA Steps
- Verify ellipsis menu opens/closes as expected and is accessible.
- Verify info icon tooltip appears on hover/focus and is accessible.
- Check that "Completed Activities" summary matches Moodle's own reports.
- Review for deprecation warnings in PHP 8.2+ logs.
